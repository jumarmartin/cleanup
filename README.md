# Cleanup
A small script written in python 3 to cleanup your desktop by file type. OS agnostic _I believe_...

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- run ```"python3 cleanup.py"``` or any flavor of python3 (python3.6 for example)


## TODO

- accept an argument to... 
	- cleanup ANY folder, not just the desktop.
	- cleanup not only by filetype, but by date, for instance.
	- append the date created or modified to the filename.
		- Or move files into a folder with the date of the cleanup in the ISO 8601 standard
	- Verbose mode 		
- Write tests!
